What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with git remote, in particular the destination aspect of it. My files kept going to the original destination rather than my forked repo.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Yes, although my question didnt really have anything to do with the gps session, it did pertain to git and github and she was able to clarify what could have been the issue and how to fix it.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
about origin and destination, git remote.
What still confuses you about Git?
No, i wouldnt say that i am confused by Git. I dont think i am as comfortable as i would like to be. So hopefully i can get soon as i work with it more and more.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was a good experience.
